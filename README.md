PyAsh Entity Framework
====================

PyAsh is a python port of the the Ashley entity framework for java.

For now, just check out their wiki/documentation on how to use. The code is commented, and methods should be
fairly similar to the orginals, so pydoc should be adequate. I'll get around to generating some api documentation at some stage in the near future
